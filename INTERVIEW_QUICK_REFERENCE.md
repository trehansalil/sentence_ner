## 📋 Data Pipeline Summary

### Dataset Characteristics
- **Size**: 1,048,576 tokens, 47,959 sentences
- **Entities**: 9 types (PER, GEO, ORG, GPE, TIM, ART, EVE, NAT, O)
- **Vocabulary**: 3,799 unique words
- **Sequence Length**: 75 tokens (optimal)

### Preprocessing Steps
1. **Load** CSV with latin-1 encoding
2. **Tokenize** and group by sentence ID
3. **Build vocabularies** (word-to-id, tag-to-id)
